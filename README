============

Cogenda Pte Ltd provides a series of patches to the SUPREM-IV in the hope
that they are useful. The patches are provided under the same license terms
as the original SUPREM-IV program (quoted above).

Cogenda does not sell SUPREM-IV. If you are seeking a commercial version of
it, please contact a commercial vendor listed in the web page
[ http://www-tcad.stanford.edu/tcad/programs/oldftpable.html ].

We do not intend to add new functionality to SUPREM-IV, since this is a
very old code base.

------------

To compile the SUPREM-IV.GS code and install the files, several changes
to the Makefile may be required.  The Makefile is documented to help
you decide what changes to make where. 

Additional changes may be required to the file src/include/sysdep.h.

Please note that in addition to C a few routines are written in FORTRAN
so you will need a FORTRAN compiler as well as C.

A Bourne shell script called suprem4gs has been included in this
distribution.  I would suggest that the actual program and data
files be stored under a non-system directory available to the
person will be responsible for the program and that the suprem4gs
file be edited to point to that directory.  If suprem4gs is then
placed in a bin directory in most user's PATH (i.e. /usr/local/bin)
updates and modifications become much simpler.
